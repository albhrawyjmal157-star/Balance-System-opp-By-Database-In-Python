# Banking System - Python & SQLite

## 📌 Project Description
This is a console-based banking system implemented in Python using SQLite for data storage.  
It allows users to create accounts, deposit and withdraw money, and check their balance.  
The system ensures that each account has a unique ID and maintains data persistence through a SQLite database.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3.x  
- SQLite (`sqlite3` module) for database storage  
- Standard Python libraries: `os`, `time`  

## 🚀 Features
- **Create Account**: Users can create accounts with a unique ID, name, and initial balance.  
- **Show Balance**: Users can view their current balance.  
- **Deposit Money**: Add funds to the account.  
- **Withdraw Money**: Withdraw funds if balance is sufficient.  
- **Input Validation**: Prevents invalid entries and negative amounts.  
- **Data Persistence**: All account information is stored in a SQLite database (`Balance System.db`).  
- **Clear Screen and User-friendly UI**: Uses `os.system` for better console readability.

## 💡 How to Run

## 🎯 Key Concepts Practiced
- Object-Oriented Programming (Classes & Methods)  
- Data persistence using SQLite  
- User input validation  
- Control flow (if-else, loops)  
- Encapsulation of data (`__balance`)  
- Console interaction and screen management
